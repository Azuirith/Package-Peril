# Package Peril

A very simple game that I decided to make in a few days using Python with Pygame. It definitely isn't perfect and the gameplay is questionable, but neither of these were the goal of the project. The goal was to make the simplest project that I could make after a long break from programming. 

Also I do know how to divide classes into different files I just like having everything in main.py when doing Python projects.
